# Middleware System

## Overview

Composable middleware pipeline using the onion execution model with before/after/on_error phases. Each middleware can inspect and modify inputs before module execution, transform outputs after execution, and participate in error recovery when failures occur. The pipeline supports both full subclass-based middleware and lightweight function adapters for simple use cases.

## Requirements

- Provide a base `Middleware` class with no-op defaults for all three lifecycle phases (before, after, on_error), allowing subclasses to override only the methods they need.
- Implement onion-model execution: before hooks run in registration order, after hooks run in reverse registration order, and on_error hooks run in reverse order over only the middlewares that executed before the failure.
- Support input modification in `before()` (return a new dict to replace inputs, or None to pass through unchanged) and output modification in `after()` (same contract).
- Support error recovery: `on_error()` handlers are called in reverse order; the first handler to return a non-None dict provides recovery output, short-circuiting the remaining handlers.
- Provide `BeforeMiddleware` and `AfterMiddleware` adapters that wrap plain callback functions as middleware instances, reducing boilerplate for single-phase hooks.
- Include a `LoggingMiddleware` with structured logging, security-aware redaction of inputs via `context.redacted_inputs`, and per-call duration tracking stored in `context.data`.
- Wrap before-phase failures in `MiddlewareChainError` carrying both the original exception and the list of executed middlewares, enabling targeted error recovery.
- Ensure all mutations to the middleware list are thread-safe.

## Technical Design

### Architecture

The middleware system follows a classic onion (layered) execution model. The `MiddlewareManager` holds an ordered list of `Middleware` instances and provides three execution methods corresponding to the module call lifecycle:

1. **`execute_before()`** -- Iterates middlewares in registration order. Each middleware's `before()` receives the current inputs and may return a replacement dict. If a middleware raises, a `MiddlewareChainError` is raised with the list of already-executed middlewares attached.

2. **`execute_after()`** -- Iterates middlewares in reverse registration order. Each middleware's `after()` receives both original inputs and the current output, and may return a replacement output dict.

3. **`execute_on_error()`** -- Iterates the `executed_middlewares` list (from the before phase) in reverse order. The first handler to return a non-None dict becomes the recovery output. If a handler itself raises, the exception is logged and iteration continues.

### Snapshot Pattern

The `MiddlewareManager` uses a lock-protected snapshot pattern for thread safety. Before each execution pass, `snapshot()` acquires the lock, copies the middleware list, and releases the lock. The execution then iterates over the snapshot without holding the lock, so concurrent `add()`/`remove()` calls do not interfere with in-flight pipelines.

### Components

- **`Middleware`** (base class) -- Plain class (not ABC) with three methods returning None by default. Subclasses override only what they need.
- **`MiddlewareManager`** -- Manages the ordered list and orchestrates the three execution phases. Uses `threading.Lock` with the snapshot pattern.
- **`BeforeMiddleware` / `AfterMiddleware`** -- Lightweight adapters wrapping a single callback function as a full `Middleware` subclass. Non-overridden phases remain no-ops.
- **`LoggingMiddleware`** -- Structured logging middleware that records start time in `context.data["_logging_mw_start"]` during `before()`, computes duration in `after()`, and uses `context.redacted_inputs` to avoid leaking sensitive data. Configurable via `log_inputs`, `log_outputs`, and `log_errors` flags.
- **`MiddlewareChainError`** -- Exception subclass carrying `original` (the root cause) and `executed_middlewares` (the list of middlewares whose `before()` was called, for targeted error recovery).

### Data Flow

```
Inputs --> [MW1.before] --> [MW2.before] --> [MW3.before] --> Module.execute()
                                                                  |
Output <-- [MW1.after]  <-- [MW2.after]  <-- [MW3.after]  <------+

On Error (if MW3.before fails):
         [MW2.on_error] <-- [MW3.on_error]
         (MW1.on_error is not called because MW3 is where before failed,
          and recovery walks backwards through executed middlewares)
```

## Key Files

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `src/apcore/middleware/__init__.py` | 16 | Package re-exports for convenient imports |
| `src/apcore/middleware/base.py` | 36 | `Middleware` base class with no-op defaults |
| `src/apcore/middleware/manager.py` | 129 | `MiddlewareManager` and `MiddlewareChainError` |
| `src/apcore/middleware/logging.py` | 94 | `LoggingMiddleware` with structured logging and redaction |
| `src/apcore/middleware/adapters.py` | 43 | `BeforeMiddleware` and `AfterMiddleware` function adapters |

## Dependencies

### Internal
- `apcore.context.Context` -- Execution context passed to all middleware methods, provides `trace_id`, `caller_id`, `redacted_inputs`, and `data` dict for per-call state storage.

### External
- `threading` (stdlib) -- Lock for thread-safe middleware list management.
- `logging` (stdlib) -- Standard library logging used by `LoggingMiddleware` and manager error reporting.
- `time` (stdlib) -- Wall-clock timing for duration measurements in `LoggingMiddleware`.

## Testing Strategy

Tests are split across two files targeting different abstraction levels:

### Unit Tests (`tests/test_middleware.py`)
- **Middleware base class**: Verifies it is not an ABC, can be instantiated directly, all methods return None by default, and subclasses can selectively override methods.
- **BeforeMiddleware adapter**: Confirms it is a `Middleware` subclass, delegates `before()` to the callback, and leaves `after()`/`on_error()` as no-ops. Validates correct argument forwarding.
- **AfterMiddleware adapter**: Same structure as `BeforeMiddleware` tests but for the `after()` phase.

### Manager Tests (`tests/test_middleware_manager.py`)
- **add/remove**: Verifies append ordering, identity-based removal, and return values.
- **execute_before**: Tests registration-order execution, input replacement via returned dicts, None passthrough, `MiddlewareChainError` on failure with correct `executed_middlewares` tracking, and empty-list passthrough.
- **execute_after**: Tests reverse-order execution, output replacement, None passthrough, exception propagation, and empty-list passthrough.
- **execute_on_error**: Tests reverse iteration over executed middlewares, first-dict-wins recovery, None continuation, exception-in-handler logging and continuation, and empty-list returns None.
- **Thread safety**: Concurrent `add()` with no lost middlewares (10 threads x 50 adds), snapshot consistency after mutations, and concurrent `add()` + `snapshot()` with no exceptions (5 writer + 5 reader threads).

### Integration Tests (`tests/integration/test_middleware_chain.py`)
- Full pipeline tests exercising middleware through the `Executor.call()` path.
