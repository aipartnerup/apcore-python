## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added

#### Core Framework
- **Schema-driven modules** - Define modules with Pydantic input/output schemas and automatic validation
- **@module decorator** - Zero-boilerplate decorator to turn functions into schema-aware modules
- **Executor** - 10-step execution pipeline with comprehensive safety and security checks
- **Registry** - Module registration and discovery system with metadata support

#### Security & Safety
- **Access Control (ACL)** - Pattern-based, first-match-wins rule system with wildcard support
- **Call depth limits** - Prevent infinite recursion and stack overflow
- **Circular call detection** - Detect and prevent circular module calls
- **Frequency throttling** - Rate limit module execution
- **Timeout support** - Configure execution timeouts per module

#### Middleware System
- **Composable pipeline** - Before/after hooks for request/response processing
- **Error recovery** - Graceful error handling and recovery in middleware chain
- **LoggingMiddleware** - Structured logging for all module calls
- **TracingMiddleware** - Distributed tracing with span support for observability

#### Bindings & Configuration
- **YAML bindings** - Register modules declaratively without modifying source code
- **Configuration system** - Centralized configuration management
- **Environment support** - Environment-based configuration override

#### Observability
- **Tracing** - Span-based distributed tracing integration
- **Metrics** - Built-in metrics collection for execution monitoring
- **Context logging** - Structured logging with execution context propagation

#### Async Support
- **Sync/Async modules** - Seamless support for both synchronous and asynchronous execution
- **Async executor** - Non-blocking execution for async-first applications

#### Developer Experience
- **Type safety** - Full type annotations across the framework (Python 3.11+)
- **Comprehensive tests** - 90%+ test coverage with unit and integration tests
- **Documentation** - Quick start guide, examples, and API documentation
- **Examples** - Sample modules demonstrating decorator-based and class-based patterns
