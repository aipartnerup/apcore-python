"""Conformance tests for OpenAI strict-mode compatibility detection.

Drives the canonical ``apcore/conformance/fixtures/openai_strict_compat.json``
(resolved by ``conformance.canonical_fixtures``), so a spec-side edit reaches
this driver on the next run rather than leaving Python on a stale snapshot.

DRIVER CONTRACT: this file MUST drive
``apcore.schema.openai_strict.detect_openai_strict_incompatibilities()`` — the
detector that backs ``BindingStrictSchemaIncompatibleError`` on the
``auto_schema: strict`` binding path (DECLARATIVE_CONFIG_SPEC.md §6.2 / §6.6).
The detector is the shared deterministic surface across the three SDKs; the
binding wrapper around it differs per SDK (Rust performs no runtime type
inference). Feature lists are compared for exact equality INCLUDING ORDER:
byte-identical output across SDKs is the point of the fixture.
