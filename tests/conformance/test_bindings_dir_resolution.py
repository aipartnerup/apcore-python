"""Cross-language driver for ``bindings_dir_resolution.json``.

PROTOCOL_SPEC §5.12.6 (spec v1.35.0, corrected v1.36.0, apcore#114): a binding
loader invoked **without an explicit directory argument** resolves the scan
directory from ``bindings.dir`` under §9.2 precedence (``APCORE_BINDINGS_DIR`` >
config file > default ``./bindings``), matches candidates against
``bindings.pattern`` through the same chain (default ``*.binding.yaml``), yields
to an explicit argument when one is given, **MUST NOT** be triggered
automatically at client or framework initialisation, and **MUST** raise rather
than return empty when the resolved directory does not exist (clause 5).

**The defect this pins is a MUST with no subject.** Through v1.34.0 the section
read "if ``bindings.dir`` is configured, implementations MUST scan files
matching ``pattern`` in that directory" and never said *who* scans or *when*. No
SDK satisfied it: ``bindings.dir`` was registered in all three key surfaces and
read by no code path, while ``BindingLoader`` was exported public API in all
three and called from no internal one. v1.35.0 names the subject (the loader)
and the trigger (an invocation that does not name a directory), which is what
makes the requirement testable at all.

**What makes a case here discriminating, and why the pre-existing tests are
not.** Every ``load_binding_dir`` test that predates apcore#114 passes an
explicit directory, and that path behaves identically before and after the fix —
so it proves nothing. The fixture's ``no_explicit_argument`` clause is therefore
load-bearing: cases with ``explicit_dir: null`` invoke the loader with the
directory argument genuinely *absent*, never with a directory this file computed
for it. ``config_construction`` is load-bearing for the same reason: each case's
``config_file`` block is written to a real file on disk and loaded through
``Config``, because the FILE tier is the one that was broken, and an in-memory
mapping bypasses it.

``env_isolation`` is honoured by :func:`_isolated_environment`, which *deletes*
every ``APCORE_*`` variable rather than blanking it. That was already true for
the reason §9.2 gives — a set-but-empty variable is still an override — and
since §9.2.1 requirement 5 it is true for a second reason: this SDK now
*discards* an empty path-typed override, so blanking would neither shadow the
file nor stand aside in the way the old comment described. Deleting is the one
form that means "not set" under both readings.

The loader is driven through ``BindingLoader.load_binding_dir``, the public
entry point an application calls. The fixture's ``entry_point`` clause forbids
reaching into a private resolution helper: §5.12.6's subject is the loader *as
invoked*, and a helper that computes the right directory while the public entry
point ignores it satisfies nothing.

**No divergence remains.** The two strict xfails this file carried are both
gone, and neither was closed by changing the SDK:

* ``missing_configured_dir_is_not_an_error`` expected an empty result where this
  SDK raises. §5.12.6 stated no outcome, so neither side was provably wrong;
  v1.36.0's clause 5 states one, and it is the raise. The case is now
  ``missing_configured_dir_raises`` and is driven as an ordinary case.
* the fixture's descriptor spelled the binding field ``target_id`` while this
  SDK's loader — and ``binding_errors.json``, and both other SDKs — require
  ``target``. §5.12.2 was the sole outlier and was corrected; the fixture's
  descriptors now spell ``target``, so the driver's rewrite shim is deleted and
  the descriptors are used as written.
