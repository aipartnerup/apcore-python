"""Conformance tests for AsyncTaskManager capacity/cancellation (A-D-003/004) fixture.

Locks two cross-language invariants:
- A-D-003: submitting beyond ``max_tasks`` MUST raise the typed
  ``TASK_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`` error (catchable by type, not a bare RuntimeError).
- A-D-004: cancelling a task while it is in retry backoff MUST stop further
  retry attempts and end in CANCELLED — expressed as a deterministic invariant
  on attempt count + final status, NOT a latency/timing assertion.
