"""Cross-language driver for ``config_path_typed_keys.json``.

PROTOCOL_SPEC §9.2.1 (spec v1.34.0, apcore#113): a *path-typed* configuration
key is one whose value is a filesystem path, the set is **closed**, and it is
declared at the schemas — a property carrying ``"x-apcore-path": true`` in
``schemas/apcore-config.schema.json`` is path-typed and no other key is.

**The defect this pins is a missing declaration, not a missing check.** Until
v1.34.0 the specification never said which configuration values are paths, so
every consumer that had to know built its own list: ``apcore-cli`` hand-
maintained ``SANDBOX_PATH_TYPED_VARS`` with a comment saying that adding a key
means editing three SDKs, and nothing detected drift between that list and the
schemas. Requirement 1 therefore asks for a *public* accessor —
``Config.path_typed_keys()`` here — because the consumer the set exists for
lives in another repository, and a private constant holding the right values
satisfies nothing.

**Both directions, every time.** The fixture's ``driver_contract`` is explicit:
compare as a SET and report the symmetric difference, never a length or a
one-way containment. "Every expected key is present" passes an implementation
that marks *every* config key as path-typed, which is exactly as wrong as
marking none and much harder to notice — hence
``bindings_pattern_is_not_path_typed`` and
``non_path_string_keys_are_not_path_typed``, the two discriminating cases that
exist only to catch the over-broad implementation.

**Scope.** This fixture asserts WHICH keys are path-typed and that the SDK
exposes the set. It asserts nothing about what a relative value resolves
against — that base is §9.2.2's subject and is driven by
``test_config_project_root.py``. A driver that starts asserting resolved
absolute paths here is testing an undecided question.

``declared_set_matches_schemas`` guards the fixture against the schemas rather
than the SDK against the fixture: it re-projects the ``x-apcore-path`` markers
out of the canonical schema files and compares that projection with the
fixture's own ``path_typed_keys`` block. A marker added to the schema without a
fixture update turns this red in all three SDKs at once.
