"""Cross-language driver for ``id_conflict_reserved_words.json``.

PROTOCOL_SPEC §2.6 step 2, narrowed to the **first segment** in spec v1.26.0
(#99). A reserved word claims a namespace, not a token, so ``foo.system.bar``
and ``executor.schema.validate`` are legal and ``system.custom_module`` is not.

The driver exercises the **public** ``register()`` path deliberately.
``register_internal()`` bypasses the reserved-word check by design, so running
the cases through it would report agreement while testing nothing.
