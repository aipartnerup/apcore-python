"""Drive `pipeline_failfast_config.json` — pipeline config fail-fast (Issue #33).

middleware-system.md § Configuration safety makes two MUSTs:

* ``PIPELINE_CONFIGURATION_ERROR`` at parse time when a key of the
  ``pipeline.configure`` MAP references an unknown step,
* ``PIPELINE_DEPENDENCY_ERROR`` at strategy construction when a ``requires:``
  is unsatisfied — never deferred to the first ``call()``.

Two things this file used to get wrong, both now fixed in the canonical
fixture rather than worked around here:

* ``pipeline.configure`` was driven as a LIST of ``{name, ...}`` entries. It is
  an object map keyed by step name — what ``$defs/PipelineConfig`` declares and
  what all three SDKs parse.
* A third case drove ``pipeline.step_middleware:``, a config section no SDK has
  ever parsed. It was removed from the fixture, not xfailed here.

Assert the WIRE CODE, not the class name: all three SDKs name the class
``ConfigurationError`` while they emitted three different codes, so a
class-name assertion passed everywhere and proved nothing.

Since aiperceivable/apcore#89 the fixture also pins the SIZE of the
configurable set: ``pipeline.configure`` accepts exactly ``match_modules``,
``ignore_errors``, ``pure``, ``timeout_ms``
(``$defs/ConfigurableStepFields`` / DECLARATIVE_CONFIG_SPEC.md §4.2).
``requires`` / ``provides`` are NOT among them — they are the step's own
capability contract, and configuration able to rewrite it disables the
``PIPELINE_DEPENDENCY_ERROR`` MUST this same fixture pins two cases above.
The accept case reads all four fields back OFF THE BUILT STEP: ``raises:
false`` alone is also satisfied by an implementation that takes the keys and
applies none of them.
