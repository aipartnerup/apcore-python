"""Drive `usage_exporter.json` — the push-style UsageExporter contract (#45 §3, D-55).

The canonical fixture states three obligations for every SDK:

1. ``NoopUsageExporter`` is the default and drops summaries without side effects.
2. ``PeriodicUsageExporter.start()`` polls ``UsageCollector`` at the configured
   interval and calls ``exporter.export(summary)`` once per tick.
3. ``PeriodicUsageExporter.stop()`` halts the loop, calls ``exporter.shutdown()``
   exactly once, and is idempotent.

``tests/observability/test_usage_exporter.py`` already asserts most of this by
hand.  That copy cannot notice when the canonical fixture gains a case, which is
why this driver reads the fixture itself and fails on an unknown case id.

Timing note: case 2 declares ``interval_seconds: 0.1`` and ``ticks: 3``.  Wall
clock is not reproducible, so this driver polls until the exporter has produced
the fixture's tick count and fails if that has not happened inside a generous
budget.  That still asserts the fixture's claim — a one-shot or never-firing
loop cannot reach three exports at any deadline — without making the suite
flaky on a loaded machine.
