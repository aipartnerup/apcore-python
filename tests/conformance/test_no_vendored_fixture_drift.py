"""Guard: no vendored fixture copies exist, and no driver reads one.

apcore-typescript and apcore-rust read the canonical fixture in the spec repo
(via ``$APCORE_SPEC_REPO`` or a sibling checkout). apcore-python used to keep
private copies under ``tests/conformance/fixtures/`` and resolve them with
``Path(__file__).parent / "fixtures"``, so a fixture that gained a case on the
spec side updated the other two SDKs silently and left Python asserting the old
snapshot. Every driver now goes through ``conformance.canonical_fixtures``.

The vendored directory has since been deleted — every copy in it was verified
byte-identical to its canonical counterpart first. These two tests keep it
deleted: a reintroduced copy is a snapshot that will drift, and a driver that
points back at this package is how the drift becomes invisible.
