"""Drive `pipeline_step_middleware.json` — StepMiddleware lifecycle (Issue #33 §2.2).

The fixture pins nine behaviours from middleware-system.md § Pipeline Step
Middleware:

* ``before_step(step_name, state)`` runs in registration order and is an
  **observation** hook — a Step is ``execute(ctx)``, so there is no ``inputs``
  parameter for a return value to replace;
* ``after_step`` and ``on_step_error`` run in **reverse** registration order
  (onion model);
* the first ``on_step_error`` returning a non-``None`` value supplies the
  recovery result and short-circuits the remaining handlers;
* ``after_step`` fires after a **recovered** step body as well as a naturally
  successful one, so the onion closes and the recovery path does not leak;
* an exception raised inside ``before_step`` is wrapped in
  ``MiddlewareChainError``, stops the chain before the step body runs, and
  triggers ``on_step_error`` on only the already-executed middlewares;
* that ``before_step`` failure is **terminal** — the ``on_step_error`` return
  value is discarded, ``after_step`` does not fire, and the step's
  ``ignore_errors`` does not apply;
* ``state.outputs`` holds exactly the steps that completed BEFORE the current
  one — the current step is never present, in any of the three hooks. Asserted
  at BOTH snapshot sites: the natural success path
  (``state_outputs_excludes_the_current_step_in_every_hook``) and the recovery
  path (``after_step_fires_after_a_recovered_step``), which the first case
  cannot reach because it recovers from nothing.

All nine are implemented by ``apcore.pipeline.PipelineEngine``; none of the
cases is an xfail.

        apcore-typescript and apcore-rust the two sites are separate lines, and
        swapping the recovery one left every conformance case green until this
        expectation existed. apcore-python has a SINGLE site — the recovery
        branch assigns ``result = recovery`` and falls through to the shared
        success tail — so the same line serves both, but the assertion is made
        here regardless: the driver must not depend on that being true.
