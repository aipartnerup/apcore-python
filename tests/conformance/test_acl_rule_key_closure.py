"""Cross-language driver for ``acl_rule_key_closure.json``.

PROTOCOL_SPEC §6.1 (spec v1.27.0, #107): ACL rule keys are a closed set, and a
rule carrying anything else fails to load. A key nothing evaluates was dropped
in silence before this, which widens an ``allow`` rule with no warning — the
§6.1.1 defect class on the pattern side rather than the condition side.
