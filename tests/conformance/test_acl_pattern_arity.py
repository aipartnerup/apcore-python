"""Cross-language driver for ``acl_pattern_arity.json``.

PROTOCOL_SPEC §6.2.1 (spec v1.31.0, apcore#112): a ``callers`` / ``targets``
pattern array's **arity** is a closed set. The array MUST carry at least one
operand, every element MUST be a non-empty string, ``$or`` at index 0 MUST be
followed by at least one pattern, ``$not`` at index 0 by exactly one, and
``$or`` / ``$not`` MUST NOT appear at any index other than 0 — a pattern array
is FLAT, the operators do not nest, and there is no precedence. Anything else is
rejected with ``ACLRuleError`` at **every** entry point that accepts a rule.

**Why a rejection and not a non-match.** Through v1.30.0 all three SDKs returned
``False`` from the matcher for ``[]``, ``["$or"]`` and ``["$not"]``, reading an
arity fault as a *scope* decision. The rule was then inert: the outcome tracked
``default_effect`` exactly and ``validate_rules()`` reported nothing. On an
``allow`` rule that is merely useless. On a ``deny`` rule under
``default_effect: allow`` the call the operator wrote the rule to block is
PERMITTED — reachable from a plain YAML file, because ``ACL.load`` rejects an
*omitted* ``callers`` / ``targets`` and permitted an *empty* one.

**Two case shapes, discriminated by ``kind``.**

``closure`` offers the rule at every door in ``entry_points`` and asserts
``expected_load``. There is deliberately no per-door expectation: a shape legal
through one door and illegal through another is precisely the defect, so the
fixture has no shape that could express it. A ``closure`` case that also carries
``expected_validation_finding_paths`` is a **tier-2** case — well-formed under
every structural rule and still matching no legal module ID, of which
``["$not", "*"]`` is the sharpest example. It MUST load, MUST be reported by
``validate_rules()``, and MUST NOT change any decision.

**A case carries either ``rule`` (one) or ``rules`` (an ordered list).** The
list form pins §6.2.1 point 2's **cross-rule** half — the index chooses the
rule, then the axis order chooses the fault inside it — and is offered at
``load`` and ``construct`` only, since ``add_rule`` takes one rule at a time and
cannot express it. ``expected_load`` sees neither half of the ordering, so
``expected_refused_axis`` and ``expected_refused_rule_index`` carry it: an
implementation with the wrong order still raises ``ACLRuleError`` for every case
here, which is exactly why the plain reject/accept expectation is not enough.
An implementation that sweeps one axis across every rule before looking at the
next passes every single-rule case and fails the discriminating pair — that is
the defect measured in apcore-typescript, whose loader validated rule by rule
while its constructor swept axis by axis, so one file produced two different
errors through two doors of the same SDK.

**"Axis" is every per-rule check a door performs**, not only ``effect`` /
``approval`` / patterns. A loader has axes the other doors cannot have — #107's
rule-key closure, the missing-field check, the value-type checks — and the sweep
prohibition binds those too: apcore-rust closed the key set across the whole
file before any rule's ``effect`` was read, and refused for rule 1 a file that
was already bad at rule 0. ``default_effect`` sits outside the scheme entirely:
it is not a rule, has no index, and is judged **first, before any rule, at every
door**, so ``expected_refused_axis: "default_effect"`` also asserts that no rule
axis and no rule index were named.

``backstop`` is the one route no door covers: assigning the field on an
**already-installed** rule, which no constructor can intercept and which —
unlike an unrecognised ``effect``, never read again once the doors are shut —
the matcher WILL consult on the next ``check()``. §6.1.4.1 then classifies it
exactly as it classifies a malformed type: the scope is unreadable, the rule is
UNEVALUABLE, and §6.1.1's effect table decides. **Two decision surfaces, and
they diverge**: ``expected_access`` is the string on the structured accessor,
``expected_legacy_check`` the legacy boolean, and §6.8.1 makes the boolean
fail-closed for allow-with-approval-required — which is
``mutated_empty_targets_on_approval_rule_raises_pending_requirement``, the case
a driver reading the boolean as if it were ``access`` fails alone.

**The doors are the substance.** ``add_rule`` is driven three ways, because they
are three different constructions of the rule and only one of them is
``ACLRule``'s: pre-built, ``add_rule``'s own kwargs path, and — since spec
v1.31.0 resolved it normatively — a rule that was **well-formed when
constructed and mutated afterwards**. That third one is the door this SDK did
not close: the check was threaded through ``ACLRule.__post_init__``, which
reaches ``add_rule`` only *through construction*, so ``r.targets = []`` followed
by ``acl.add_rule(r)`` inserted without raising. The fixture cannot express the
difference — ``entry_points`` carries no per-door expectation — so the third
callable below is what pins it.
