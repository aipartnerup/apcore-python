"""Built-in ACL condition handlers and handler protocols.

Defines the ACLConditionHandler protocol (sync and async variants), the
three-valued :class:`ConditionOutcome` of PROTOCOL_SPEC §6.1.1, three basic
handlers (identity_types, roles, max_call_depth), and two compound operators
($or, $not) with both sync and async variants.

The compound operators are **path-aware** (§6.1.4): they receive the condition
path they sit at so a fault nested inside them can be reported as
``$or[1].$not.k`` rather than as a bare key. A key can occur at several
positions in one tree, which is why diagnostics are ordered by path and not by
key.
