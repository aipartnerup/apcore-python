    :func:`_validate_effect` is one function: two copies of a value set are two
    things that drift, which is how the loader came to be the only door that
    checked ``effect``.

    A pattern array is **FLAT** (§6.2.1). The operators do not nest, there is no
    precedence, an operand is always a plain pattern string, and there is
    exactly one operator position — index 0. So the shape is finite, decidable

    2. every element MUST be a non-empty string;
    3. ``$or`` at index 0 MUST be followed by at least one pattern;
    4. ``$not`` at index 0 MUST be followed by **exactly** one;
    5. ``$or`` / ``$not`` MUST NOT appear at any index other than 0.

    Through spec v1.30.0 none of this was enforced anywhere, while
    ``schemas/acl-config.schema.json`` had declared ``minItems: 1`` and
    ``minLength: 1`` since the file existed — the third instance of #107's and
    #111's shape, in which the normative artefact declared the constraint and no
    entry point enforced it. The matcher read the arity fault as a *scope*
    decision and returned False, which makes an ``allow`` rule merely useless
    and a ``deny`` rule a **fail-open**: under ``default_effect: allow`` the call
    the operator wrote the rule to block was permitted, by a rule that loaded
    without error and a validator that called it clean.

    ``effect`` -> ``approval`` -> ``callers`` / ``targets`` that it fails, so
    the same rule produces the same error in every implementation. §6.1.6 rule 2
    *implies* that ``effect`` is read before ``approval`` — judging "``deny``
    plus ``approval: required``" requires knowing the effect — but it states no
    order, which is why three implementations had three: ``{callers: [],
    targets: [], effect: "Allow"}`` was refused for its ``effect`` in one and
    for its patterns in another, and a third ran ``effect`` -> patterns ->
    ``approval``. All were conformant, because nothing said otherwise.

    ``effect`` comes first because the pairing rule below it is read *off* the
    effect: ``effect: "DENY"`` with ``approval: required`` is not a ``deny``
    rule, so reporting the pairing would name a rule the specification does not
    recognise.

    §6.2.1's *shape* closure together, with the type fault first — a value must
    be a list of strings before its arity means anything — and ``callers``
    before ``targets``. Only the shape half is a door rejection here; the type
    fault is unrepresentable in apcore-rust, so it is reported by
    :meth:`ACL._precheck_patterns`, which gives it the same precedence within
    the same field order.

    **Rule index dominates all three axes** (§6.2.1). A rule *set* with more
    than one bad rule MUST be refused for the LOWEST-INDEXED bad rule, and an
    implementation MUST NOT sweep one axis across every rule before looking at
    the next. That is a property of the callers rather than of this function:
    :meth:`ACL.load` validates rule by rule in file order, and ``ACL(rules=[...])``
    validates each :class:`ACLRule` as it is constructed, so both refuse the
    first bad rule rather than the first bad axis. Sweeping is how one
    implementation came to report a lower-indexed rule's pattern fault from its
    loader and a higher-indexed rule's ``effect`` fault from its constructor,
    for the same file.

    **One function, called at every door**, which is §6.2.1's first point of
    order: a rule offered to :meth:`ACL.add_rule` MUST be validated *at that
    moment*, whatever its history — including a rule that was
    well-formed when constructed and has since had ``callers`` or ``targets``
    assigned — and an implementation MUST NOT rely on the rule type's own
    construction-time check to cover that door. Threading the check through
    :meth:`ACLRule.__post_init__` alone reaches ``add_rule`` only *through

        A value that is not a list of strings is a malformed rule, not a pattern
        set. A bare string is iterable, so ``callers: "admin.*"`` written where
        ``callers: ["admin.*"]`` was meant is read character by character — and
        ``*`` is a valid pattern matching everything, so an ``allow`` rule
        carrying that typo granted access to **every caller**. A non-subscriptable
        scalar raised ``TypeError`` out of ``check()``, which its contract forbids.

        Since spec v1.31.0 (§6.2.1, #112) the **arity** is checked here too. That
        half is the backstop for the one route no door covers: :class:`ACLRule`
        is a non-frozen dataclass, so ``rule.targets = []`` reaches the evaluator
        whatever the constructors check. §6.1.5's v1.30.0 reasoning for why the
        ``effect`` closure needs no backstop — the value is never read again once
        the doors are shut — does **not** transfer, because a mutated pattern
        array *is* read: the matcher consults it on the next ``check()``. An
        array outside §6.2.1's closure is therefore a precheck fault on exactly
        the same terms as a malformed type: the rule's scope is unreadable, the
        rule is UNEVALUABLE, and §6.1.1's effect table decides — a ``deny`` rule
        takes effect and denies, an ``allow`` rule does not match and MUST NOT
        grant. §6.1.4.1 has no partially-readable tier: ``targets: []`` is
        legible as an empty scope in a way ``targets: 3`` is not, and acting on
        that difference is the per-implementation judgement call that produced
        three different answers in #100.

        Tier 2 — an array that is well-formed under every clause above and still
        matches nothing — is deliberately **not** here. It is

        A **separate predicate** from :meth:`_precheck_patterns` on purpose. It
        is consulted by :meth:`validate_rules` after the precheck reports the
        field clean, and it MUST NOT reach ``handler_error`` or any access
        decision: such a rule loads, is reported, and decides exactly as it did
        before — ``["$not", "*"]`` on a ``deny`` rule under
        ``default_effect: allow`` still lets an unrelated call through.

        Why a finding and not a rejection. Closing §6.2.1's arities does not
        exhaust the inert class — ``["$not", "*"]`` has perfectly legal arity,
        exactly one operand, and matches nothing, producing the identical
        fail-open — but detecting it means reasoning about the **match
        relation** rather than the array's shape, and that predicate cannot be
        closed without freezing the pattern language. §6.1.4's determinism
        guarantee binds precheck-origin diagnostics because they feed
        ``handler_error`` and the decision; tier-2 findings feed neither, so a
        divergence between SDKs is a missed diagnostic rather than an ACL file
        that loads in one language and fails in another. §6.1.3 governs: this is
        diagnostics, not enforcement.

        The criterion is normative and this list is §6.2.1's MUST-detect

        key, both resolvability flags False), so a reader cannot tell the tiers
        apart and does not need to.

        Loading an ACL only warns, because handler registration is a runtime,
        process-wide act that legitimately happens after discovery; this method
        is what a deployment calls once registration is complete, so it can turn
        a broken rule into a startup error of its own choosing.

        when ``async_resolvable`` is true (§6.1.3 rule 3). An async-only handler
        is a working condition under :meth:`async_check` and an unevaluable one
        under :meth:`check`; an application that only ever calls ``async_check``
        may ignore such a finding, but that judgement belongs to the caller, not
        to the validator.

        ``acl.root`` is a directory by spec convention (``acl/{scope}_acl.yaml``,

        could not be evaluated (PROTOCOL_SPEC §6.1.1) — which the caller resolves
        toward refusing access.

        Order is normative (§6.1.4 rule 4):

        a. The **structure** of ``callers`` / ``targets`` is prechecked before any
           pattern is read, because reading a malformed one is the §6.1.4.1
           fail-open.
        b. A malformed pattern field makes the rule unevaluable — its scope is
           unknowable, so it resolves per §6.1.1's effect table.
        c. Both fields well-formed and either failing to match means the rule
           **does not apply to this call**. Its conditions are not consulted, its
           faults do not reach ``handler_error``, and it does not change this
           decision. Otherwise one misspelled key in a narrowly scoped rule would
           decide calls it was never written about — ``callers: ["api.*"]`` with
           a typo'd condition denying a ``worker.*`` caller — which breaks
           first-match-wins. The fault is still real; :meth:`validate_rules`
           looks at every rule and no call, and is where it surfaces.
        d. Only then is the conditions tree prechecked, in full and context-free,
           **before** §6.5's no-context check. That ordering closes the bypass
           where ``conditions: {mispelled: true}`` on a ``deny`` rule passed
           traffic simply because the caller carried no identity.

        A rule that *passes* the precheck and then finds no context takes §6.5's
        path and does not match. ``roles`` is answerable in principle; this
        caller merely supplied no input for it.

        ``approval: required``: the narrow rule gating ``git push --force``
        steps aside, a broader ``allow`` grants, and the call the operator gated
        runs with no human asked. So the requirement is recorded and composed by
        disjunction with whatever grants later, rather than discarded.

        **Scope is a precondition, and the caller has already enforced it.** A
        rule whose ``callers`` / ``targets`` do not match resolves to
        UNSATISFIED in :meth:`_matches_rule` and never reaches here (§6.1.4
        rule 4), so a rule written about one caller cannot attach a human to
        calls it was never written about. A rule whose pattern field is itself
        **malformed** does reach here, from the §6.1.4.1 precheck that runs
        before any pattern is read — deliberately, per rule 5's last clause: its
        scope cannot be read, so it cannot be shown not to apply here, which is
        the posture that field already produces under ``deny``, where an
        unreadable scope denies every call.

        The ``effect == "allow"`` test is the exact complement of the caller's
        ``deny`` branch, and only because §6.1.5 closed the value set at every
        door in spec v1.30.0: there is no third value for a rule to carry, so
        "not deny" and "allow" are now the same question.

                (§6.1.5), when ``approval="required"`` is combined with

                empty, ``$or`` with no operand, ``$not`` with none or more than
                one, an empty pattern string, or a reserved token anywhere but

                entry points §6.1.6 rule 3 requires all of these checks at; this
                method returning ``None`` is not an exemption, so it signals the
                way Python signals a value that cannot be constructed.

                The rule is validated **here**, on the object this method is
                handed, and not only by :class:`ACLRule`'s own constructor
                (§6.2.1). A pre-built rule may have been well-formed when it was
                constructed and had ``callers`` or ``targets`` assigned since —
                :class:`ACLRule` is a non-frozen dataclass — and such a rule
                reaches this door without passing through any constructor.

        Note:
            A condition key with no registered handler warns and does not
            raise, exactly as on :meth:`load` (PROTOCOL_SPEC §6.1.2 rule 4).
